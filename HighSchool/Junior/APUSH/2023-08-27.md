**let's be for real: the real world royally sucks. What would you rather be doing right now?**

_I would rather be playing video games with my friends, or going to parties with them._

**lilith is so tense and stressedddd. what do you recommend for them to just... take a break? maybe suggest something that you do too**

_Something I recommend to people who are stressed is to go drive or take a walk in a secluded area. You don't have to necessarily go anywhere but it helps clear the mind._

**why be practical when you can be delulu? argue this stance for 2 stars (if it's not clear, you're in support of being delulu)**

Being practical can help you in a lot of "physical" ways. However, something I think that's more important is your emotional status. I consider the goal of life to be happy. The smarter you get the less happy you are, while this claim isn't super backed with scientific data there are some examples of people (Albert Einstein). Being "delulu" can help your mental status and morph your worldview into a positive one regardless of your physical situation. A common quote that comes to mind when my worldview becomes to bleak is "ignorance is bliss".

**Even though it's common knowledge that being delulu is the solulu, water is still good for you. go drink water or else lemme know when you do itttt!**
