## <span id="sc">Contextualization</span>

According to the historian, James Henretta "Historical events make more sense when they are studied alongside similar events."
(Henretta, America's History, 2018, p. lii.)

Historians know that any event can only be understood in context

Two levels of context, an immediate or short-term context and a broad, or long-term context.
(Henretta, America's History, 2018, p. lii.)

### <span id="sec">What is context?</span>

<span id="i">Context refers to the historical circumstances surrounding an event in a larger context.</span>  Usually, two to three sentences will explain contextualization in your essay. E.g. Learning something in Unit-1 and then referring to it in Unit-2 to give <span id="i">context</span>.
