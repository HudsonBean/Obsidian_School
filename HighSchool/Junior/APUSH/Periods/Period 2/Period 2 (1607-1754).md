## <span id="c">Chapter 2</span>

### <span id="sc">English Colonization</span>

#### <span id="sec">Early Efforts</span>
The first attempt at English colonization was led by Sir Walter Raleigh to colonize Roanoke Island. This attempt failed after the entire colony went missing. Gained the name the "Lost Colony" of Roanoke.

#### <span id="sec">Jamestown</span>
The first permanent and successful English settlement was in 1607. The settlement faced numerous challenges, including conflicts with Native Americans, disease, and famine.

### <span id="sc">Development of the Southern Colonies</span>
#### <span id="sec">Maryland - 1632</span>
Established as a safe haven for English Catholics, Maryland also adopted the [[Headright System]].
**Religion**: <span id="i">Protestantism</span>
**Government**: <span id="i">Lords Proprietors (and Royal Governors. in 1692)</span>

#### <span id="sec">Carolina -  1663</span>
Initially founded for its strategic importance, it eventually split into North and South Carolina, each with its distinct economy and social structure

The Carolinas unofficially split in 1712 as they had differences in how they ran things and it became hard for one government to manage everything. Differences such as economies, geographies, and populations.
##### North Carolina - 1729 (1712)
**Religion**: <span id="i">Church of England (Anglicanism)</span>
**Government**: <span id="i">Lords Proprietors and appointedÂ Royal Governors.</span>
Had more of a <span id="i">decentralized</span> government which better suited their population of small, independent farms.

##### South Carolina - 1729 (1712)
**Religion**: <span id="i">Church of England (Anglicanism)</span>
**Government**: <span id="i">Lords Proprietors and appointedÂ Royal Governors.</span>
Had more of a <span id="i">centralized</span> government which was largely influenced by wealthy plantation owners. They had lots of cash crops that needed hard labor to yield and so they were big on plantations and slave labor.

#### <span id="sec">Georgia - 1732</span>
The last of the 13 colonies. It was founded as a buffer against Spanish Florida and as a place for debtors and the poor.
**Religion**: <span id="i">Church of England (Anglicanism)</span>
**Government**: <span id="i">Controlled by trustees located in London</span>
#### <span id="sec">Virginia - 1607</span>
We already had Virginia from Jamestown.

#### <span id="sec">Plymouth and the Pilgrims</span>
Pilgrims, who were separatists from the Church of England, <span id="i">founded Plymouth in 1620</span>

## <span id="c">Chapter 4</span>

### <span id="sc">Life in the Chesapeake Region</span>

- <span id="i">Life was very poor. </span>
- <span id="i">Most of the immigrants were young men in their teens or twenties.</span> 
- <span id="i">The men outnumbered the women six to one.</span>
- <span id="i">No families really.</span>
- <span id="i">The terrain was murky and nasty.</span>

---

### <span id="sc">The Tobacco Economy</span>

- <span id="i">Tobacco was a huge money maker. Often profit-hungry settlers would plant tobacco before they planted food.</span>
- <span id="i">Some ships hauled over 1.5 million pounds of Tobacco.</span>
- <span id="i">This intense Tobacco planting exhausted the soil. Causing the farmers to move farther up causing more conflict with the Indians.</span>

Planting all this tobacco means we need more <span id="i">labor.</span> Where should we get this labor? Slaves were too expensive, Indians died too quickly, and there were hardly any families at all. So let's look to <span id="i">Indentured servants.</span> In exchange, they <span id="i">received transatlantic passage and eventual â€œfreedom dues", including a few barrels of corn, a suit of clothes, and perhaps a small parcel of land. </span> Both Virginia and Maryland employed the "[[headright system]]" which essentially gave each <span id="i">settler 50 acres of land for themselves and an additional 50 acres for every person they brought along (e.g. servants).</span> The system was used to encourage the colonization of America. Often servants that earned their freedom would <span id="i">come out penniless and go back to working for their former masters for low wages.</span>

---

### <span id="sc">Frustrated Freeman and Bacon's rebellion ðŸ’ª</span>

A lot of young free men were now wandering the Chesapeake region as of the late seventeenth century. <span id="i">These men were frustrated due to their broken dreams of owning land as well as their failures in acquiring spouses.</span> The governor doesn't like the free men. The <span id="i">Virginia Assembly disenfranchised them.</span>

#### <span id="sec">Bacon's rebellion</span>
Led 1,000 Virginias in a rebellion against Governor Berkeley. Rebels resented Berkeley's close relations with Indians. Berkeley monopolized the fur trade with the Indians in the area.

- Rebels attacked Indians, whether they were friendly or not to whites.
- Governor Berkeley was driven from Jamestown.
- They burned the capital.
	- Rebels went on a rampage of plundering.
- Bacon suddenly died of fever.


#### <span id="sec">Results of Bacon's Rebellion</span>
It exposed resentment between inland frontiersmen and landless former servants against the gentry on coastal plantations.
- Socioeconomic class differences/ clashes between rural and urban communities would continue throughout American history.

---

### <span id="sc">Colonial Slavery</span>

After Bacon's rebellion, they no longer wanted to use indentured servants for labor for many reasons such as:
- Potential for unrest (Might have another revolt)
	
- Decreasing supply (England started to improve by reducing the number of people wanting to indenture themselves to get free passage to the new colony)
	
- High Turnover (Indentured servants were only servants for a little while and then they received freedom dues and became free citizens)
	
- Racial perceptions and Control (don't have to explain this one)
	
- Economic Efficiency (As the tobacco farming in Virginia increased they needed a stable long-term labor source)
	
- Legal Changes (Such as the lifelong servitude of African Americans and their children being slaves)

Slaves would usually be captured by African coastal tribes that would then sell them to European colonizers from the New World. After a while the African Americans started outnumbering the white population quite a bit. The law got very specific on what constitutes a slave and what constitutes an indentured servant. These new "slave codes" made the slaves a slave for life as well as their children slaves for life.

### <span id="sc">Africans in America ðŸ¤ </span>

In the deeper south slave life was severe and harsh, the climate was hostile to health, and the labor was life-draining. The scattered South Carolina rice and indigo plantations were lonely hells on earth. The only way they <span id="i">could support a stable African-American population is through constant imports.</span> However, the blacks working in the Chesapeake area had it significantly better for the following reasons:
- Tobacco was a significantly less physically demanding crop.
- The size and proximity of the plantations allowed more frequent contact with friends and relatives.
- By about 1720 the proportion of African American females had begun to rise, making families possible.
Due to these reasons, the Slave population began to increase not only through imports but through its own fertility too; making it one of the few slave societies in history to perpetuate itself by its own natural reproduction.

### <span id="sc">trans-Atlantic trade network</span>

The colonies produced profitable <span id="i">raw materials, such as tobacco, wheat, fish, indigo, & whale oil</span>
Britain sold <span id="i">manufactured goods back to the colonists, like clothing, tea, guns, & tableware.</span>

South produced a lot of:
- Tobacco
- Rice
- Indigo
Middle produced:
- Wheat
New England produced:
- Fish
- Whale Oil

#### <span id="sec">Mercantilism</span>
By the 1650s, Britain began to embrace the economic policy of mercantilism based on the idea that the colonies existed to generate wealth for the mother country.

<span id="i">Silver and gold are good. We wanna stockpile it within our empire. We want to spend less than we make. Have a good trade balance.</span>

#### <span id="sec">Navigation Acts</span>

Mercantilism meant that Britain began to control & regulate colonial trade.
In 1660, Britain began the first of a series of <span id="i">Navigation Acts</span> designed to restrict colonial trade & increase British wealth.
The Navigation Acts required the colonists to trade only with Britain.
- No country could trade with the colonies unless the goods were shipped in either colonial or English ships.
- All vessels had to be operated by crews that were at least three-quarters English or colonial.
- The colonies could export certain products only to England.
- Almost all goods traded between the colonies and Europe first had to pass through an English port.
<span id="i">Salutary neglect</span> is that the British did have navigation laws but didn't enforce them. These stupid laws made all the colonies upset since over the years they developed a sense of individualism.

Basically, things that encouraged or caused the transatlantic trade network were:
- Mercantilism
- Bacon's rebellion shifted from Indentured Servants to slaves.


Southern economies were dominated by cash-crop agriculture, plantations rather than cities, large gaps between rich, poor, & slave

### <span id="sc">South vs. North</span>


## <span id="c">Review</span>

### <span id="sc">Puritans</span>
<span id="sec">Visible Sainthood</span>


<span id="sec">Societal Covenant</span>


<span id="sec">Half Way Covenant</span>
Changed the concept of being a full member of the church. <span id="i">A loosening of the restrictions the church had, which upsetted a few people.</span>

<span id="sc">Massachusets Bay - 1629</span>
- Non-Separatist Puritans
	- Cambridge Agreement
- Great Migration (1630's)
- Religion & Politics
- Congregationalist


Puritan Paradoxes
- Puritans want a bible based Protestant society, but also want to uphold their correct way of reading scripture.
- Puritans come to escape persecution but don't allow religious freedom to others.

### <span id="sc">Education in New England</span>
<span id="sec">"Old Deluder Satan" Act (1647)</span>
Required kids to go to school to read the bible, and for towns to have a school after a certain amount of population.

<span id="sec">Harvard College</span>
The oldest institution of higher learning in the US. <span id="i">Used to educate clergy in reading the bible</span>.

### <span id="sc">Decline of Puritanism</span>
- Lost religious zeal
	- Decrease in conversions
	- Jeremiads
- Half Way Covenant, 1662
- Baptism for All
- Salem Witch Trials, 1692

### <span id="sc">Economy of New England</span>
- Impacted by geography and demographics
- less ethnic diversity
- Protestant Work Ethic.

### <span id="sc">Overview of the Great Awakening</span>
- 1st Mass Social Movement in America
- Tow issues:
	- Crisis within the ministry
	- Crisis between clergy and the laity
- Reaction to the elaborate theological doctrines and emotional stagnation
- Arminianism - Directly challenged Calvinism's predestination saying that man was not helpless in achieving salvation.

#### <span id="sec">Jonathon Edwards</span>
- Credited with starting the Great Awakening.
- Most influential theological writer and thinker of the movement.
- Believed in dependence on God's grace.
- Emphasized eternal damnation.

#### <span id="sec">Old Lights vs. New Lights</span>
- Old Lights: Orthodox and liberal clergymen were deeply skeptical of emotionalism and the theatrics of the revivalists.
- New Lights: supported the Awakening for revitalizing American religion; used emotionalism to move followers.

#### <span id="sec">Significance of the great Awakening</span>
- Split denominations thus increasing the competitiveness of American churches
- Converted many thousands of people
- Undermined the powerful older clergy
- Encouraged a new wave of missionary work among Amerindians and slaves
- Founding of "new light" followers

**How did the Great Awakening lead to American Constitutionalism?**

Basically this huge creation of individualism and nationalism, and gave all these civil liberties.
