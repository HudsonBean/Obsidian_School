## <div id="sc">What was it?</div>
The encomienda system was a labor system established by the Spanish Crown in the American colonies. Under this system, Spanish encomenderos were granted the right to extract forced labor and tribute from indigenous populations in exchange for offering them protection and Christian education. The encomienda system led to the exploitation and decimation of native communities and is often cited as a form of legalized slavery.
## <div id="sc">Impact</div>
The encomienda system had a profound and <span id="i">largely negative impact on both the New World and the Old World. In the New World, it led to the exploitation, forced labor, and decimation of indigenous populations. Native communities were stripped of their autonomy, their resources plundered, and their cultures often irreparably harmed.</span>

In the Old World, particularly in Spain, the encomienda system contributed to the influx of wealth in the form of extracted resources like gold and silver. While this wealth boosted the Spanish economy and financed further expeditions and colonization, it also contributed to inflation and economic imbalances within Europe. Furthermore, debates over the morality and legality of the encomienda system had a lasting impact on Spanish law and Catholic Church doctrine concerning the treatment of indigenous people.

In summary, the encomienda system led to significant social, cultural, and economic disruptions, deeply affecting communities and nations on both sides of the Atlantic.
