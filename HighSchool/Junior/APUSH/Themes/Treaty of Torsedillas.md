## <div id="sc">What was it?</div>
The Treaty of Tordesillas was an <span id="i">agreement between Portugal and Spain</span>, concluded in 1494, that aimed to <span id="i">divide newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries</span>. The treaty was ratified by Pope Alexander VI and established a meridian approximately halfway between the Cape Verde Islands (already Portuguese) and the Caribbean islands that Christopher Columbus first visited (claimed for Spain). Lands to the east of the line would belong to Portugal, while lands to the west of the line would belong to Spain.
## <div id="sc">Impact</div>
The Treaty of Tordesillas was significant for several reasons:

- It aimed to resolve conflicts between the two most powerful maritime nations of the time, preventing them from overlapping claims.
- The treaty had a long-lasting impact on colonialism in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, as it gave Portugal a more or less free hand in Africa and Brazil, while Spain got most of Latin America.
- It's often cited as an early example of European disregard for the existing populations of colonized areas, as it made no provision for the rights or welfare of indigenous peoples.
- The line was often disputed or ignored by other European nations, and it was not a perfectly accurate division due to the limited geographical knowledge of the time.
<br />
In summary, the Treaty of Tordesillas played a pivotal role in the European colonization and exploration of the "New World" and had a significant impact on the geopolitical landscape for centuries to come.
