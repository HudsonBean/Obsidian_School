### <span id="sec">ese</span>
<span id="i">Ese is a pronoun but ése is an adjective</span>, however, these accent marks are now considered optional and ese without the marks can function fine on their own.
1. It can work to be like an adjective to something e.g. "ese libro" = "that book"
2. It can replace full nouns "¿Cuál libro? Ese." = "Which book? That one."
Do note that you can't use it to make connections (conjunctions) instead use "que".

## <span id="sc">Què y que</span>
Qué = "what"
Que = "That" o "Than"
