## <span id="sc">Determine an Appropriate Speech Topic and Goal</span>
- <span id="i">Rhetorical situation</span> is comprised of you(your knowledge and intentions), the audience, and the occasion.
- Each speech needs an <span id="i">exigence</span> basically a reason to exist.
- Effective speech goals are based on:
	- <span id="i">audience analysis</span> the study of the intended audience.
	- <span id="i">audience adaptation</span> is the process of tailoring the speech to address their unique needs, interests, and expectations.
Effective communicators use what's known as <span id="i">uncertainty reduction theory</span> essentially adapting their speech to their audience throughout the speech's preparation and presentation process. They do this after they determine a **SPECIFIC SPEECH GOAL**. 
### <span id="sec">Identifying Potential Topics</span>
- <span id="i">Subject</span> broad area of knowledge.
- <span id="i">Topic</span> is a narrower aspect of the subject.
#### <span id="ssec">Identifying Topics</span>

	- uncritical.
	- non-evaluative.
	- process of generating associated ideas.
	- <span id="i">List as many ideas as you think you can without evaluating them yet.</span>
- <span id="i">Concept mapping</span>
	- visual means of exploring connections between a subject and related ideas.
#### <span id="ssec">Analyze the Audience</span>

- Initial level of interest in.
- Attitude toward the potential topics you are considering.

- Conduct a survey.
- Observe informally.
- Question a representative.
- Make educated guesses.
##### <span id="sp">Ethical Use of Audience Data</span>

To demonstrate respect for everyone, you will want to avoid making inappropriate or inaccurate marginalizing and stereotyping.
- <span id="i">Marginalizing</span> is the practice of ignoring the values, needs, and interests of some audience members, leaving them to feel excluded.
- <span id="i">Stereotyping</span> is assuming all members of a group have similar knowledge, behaviors, or beliefs simply because they belong to that group.
#### <span id="ssec">Examine the Occasion</span>
- <span id="i">What is the intended purpose (exigence) of the speech?</span> Why does the audience think this speech is being given?
- <span id="i">What is the expected length?</span>
- <span id="i">Where will the speech be given?</span> Adapt to your space e.g. a big room requires a louder volume to be adequately heard.
- <span id="i">When equipment is necessary and available?</span> e.g. Microphone?
### <span id="sec">Write a Speech Goal Statement</span>
#### <span id="ssec">General and Specific Speech Goals</span>
- The <span id="i">general goal</span> is the overall intent of the speech.
- The <span id="i">Specific Speech Goal</span> is a single statement that identifies the desired response a speaker wants from the audience. e.g. if your speech is about honey bees a specific speech goal might say "I want my audience to understand the four different types of honey bees".
