# <span id="c">Chapter 11</span>
## <span id="sc">Determine an Appropriate Speech Topic and Goal</span>
- <span id="i">Rhetorical situation</span> is comprised of you(your knowledge and intentions), the audience, and the occasion.
- Each speech needs an <span id="i">exigence</span> basically a reason to exist.
- Effective speech goals are based on:
	- <span id="i">audience analysis</span> the study of the intended audience.
	- <span id="i">audience adaptation</span> is the process of tailoring the speech to address their unique needs, interests, and expectations.
Effective communicators use what's known as <span id="i">uncertainty reduction theory</span> essentially adapting their speech to their audience throughout the speech's preparation and presentation process. They do this after they determine a **SPECIFIC SPEECH GOAL**. 
### <span id="sec">Identifying Potential Topics</span>
- <span id="i">Subject</span> broad area of knowledge.
- <span id="i">Topic</span> is a narrower aspect of the subject.
#### <span id="ssec">Identifying Topics</span>
- <span id="i">Brainstorming</span>
	- uncritical.
	- non-evaluative.
	- process of generating associated ideas.
	- <span id="i">List as many ideas as you think you can without evaluating them yet.</span>
- <span id="i">Concept mapping</span>
	- visual means of exploring connections between a subject and related ideas.
#### <span id="ssec">Analyze the Audience</span>
##### <span id="sp">Demographic Data</span>

Helpful information about the audience
e.g.
- Their approximate age
- education level
- sex
- income
- occupation
- socioeconomic status
##### <span id="sp">Subject-Related Data</span>

- Their level of knowledge.
- Initial level of interest in.
- Attitude toward the potential topics you are considering.
##### <span id="sp">Data Gathering Methods</span>

- Conduct a survey.
- Observe informally.
- Question a representative.
- Make educated guesses.
##### <span id="sp">Ethical Use of Audience Data</span>

To demonstrate respect for everyone, you will want to avoid making inappropriate or inaccurate marginalizing and stereotyping.
- <span id="i">Marginalizing</span> is the practice of ignoring the values, needs, and interests of some audience members, leaving them to feel excluded.
- <span id="i">Stereotyping</span> is assuming all members of a group have similar knowledge, behaviors, or beliefs simply because they belong to that group.
#### <span id="ssec">Examine the Occasion</span>
- <span id="i">What is the intended purpose (exigence) of the speech?</span> Why does the audience think this speech is being given?
- <span id="i">What is the expected length?</span>
- <span id="i">Where will the speech be given?</span> Adapt to your space e.g. a big room requires a louder volume to be adequately heard.
- <span id="i">When equipment is necessary and available?</span> e.g. Microphone?
### <span id="sec">Write a Speech Goal Statement</span>
#### <span id="ssec">General and Specific Speech Goals</span>
- The <span id="i">general goal</span> is the overall intent of the speech.
- The <span id="i">Specific Speech Goal</span> is a single statement that identifies the desired response a speaker wants from the audience. e.g. if your speech is about honey bees a specific speech goal might say "I want my audience to understand the four different types of honey bees".
**Informative** increases knowledge, understanding, and appreciation.
**Persuasive** Reinforce a belief, change a belief, and/or call to action.
#### <span id="ssec">Phrasing a Specific Goal Statement</span>
- Write a first draft of your specific speech goal statement.
- Make sure the goal statement contains only one central idea.
- Revise the statement until it clearly articulates the desired audience response.
## <span id="sc">Locate and Evaluate Information Sources</span>
### <span id="sec">Primary Research</span>
is collecting data from the "real world". e.g. Surveys, informal observations, etc.
### <span id="sec">Secondary Research</span>
is locating information that other people have discovered. e.g. Books, Newspapers, etc.
#### <span id="ssec">4 Criteria for evaluating sources:</span>
- Currency (less than five years old is preferred)
- Reliability (Is the information unbiased and supported by evidence? Know the difference between .edu, .gov, .org, .com & .net)
- Authority (Who is the author/publisher/sponsor?)
- Purpose (It is informative, persuasive, propaganda, entertainment, etc.?)
**When researching, use a Variety of Sources.**
1. Factual Statements (statistics, examples)
2. Expert Opinions (doctors, scientists, professors, etc.)
3. Elaborations (anecdotes, narratives, comparison/contracts, & quotations)
# <span id="c">Chapter 12</span>
- Speech Framework: Introduction, Body (develop first), & Conclusion.
	1. How do you determine your main points?
		- **List** the ideas you believe relate to your specific goal.
		- **Eliminate** ideas you believe the audience already understands or are too complicated for the time allotted.
		- **Choose** 2-4 ideas that are left to accomplish your goal.
		- **Write** your thesis/purpose statement that incorporates your general goal and previews your main points.
	2. Basic Patterns for Speech Organization
		- **Chronological order**: time or sequential order
		- **Narrative order**: conveys ideas through a story or series of stories.
		- **Topical order**: arranges main points as examples of one major topic.
		-  **Logical Reasons Order**: we will go into more detail on various persuasive styles when we study Chapter 17
		- **Compare & contrast**: shows the similarities and differences between two topics.
		- **Spatial**: organizes info according to how things fit together in physical space.
	3. Function of the Introduction: get the audience's attention, establish relevance & credibility, and state purpose.
		- **HOW?** Startling statement/statistic, rhetorical or direct question, stories, jokes, personal experience, quotation, or physical action.
	4. Function of the Conclusion: summarize main points, restate goal, and leave zinger(clincher).
		- HOW? You can use any of the devices discussed with introductions.
	5. Transitions are words, phrases, or sentences, that show the relationship between two ideas. e.g. first, second, finally, etc.
# <span id="c">Chapter 13</span>
A <span id="i">Presentational aid</span> is any visual, audio, audiovisual, or other sensory material used to enhance a verbal message.
## <span id="sc">Types of Presentational Aids</span>
- **Visual Aids**
	- **Actual Objects**
	- **Models** (An actual object but rather a scaled-down version of something larger)
	- **Photographs**
	- **Simple Drawings and Diagrams**
	- **Maps** allow you to orient audiences to landmarks, states, cities, etc.
	- **Charts** distill a lot of information into an easily interpreted visual format.
	- **Graphs** present numerical information in visual form.
- **Audio Aids** enhance a verbal message through sound.
- **Audiovisual Aids** enhance a verbal message using a combination of sight and sound.
- **Other Sensory Aids** appeal to other senses like touch, taste, etc.
## <span id="sc">Choosing Presentational Aids</span>
- illustrate the most important ideas to understand and remember.
- clarify complex ideas that are difficult to explain verbally.
- are appropriate for the size of the audience.
- make dull information and details more interesting.
- you will feel comfortable using and transporting to the speech site.
- enhance rather than overwhelm the verbal message.
- you have the time and money to prepare
- demonstrate cultural sensitivity and do not offend members of your audience.
## <span id="sc">Preparing Presentational Aids</span>
- Limit the reading required of the audience.
- Customize presentational aids from other sources.
- Use a photo, print, or type size that can be seen easily and a volume and sound quality that can be heard easily by your entire audience.
- Use a consistent print style that is easy to read.
- Make sure information is laid out in a way that is aesthetically pleasing.
- Use Graphic illustration in visuals.
- Use color strategically.
	- Use the same background color and theme for all your presentational aids.
	- Use the same color to show similarities and use opposite colors.
	- Use bright colors, such as red, to highlight important information. Be sure to avoid using red and green together, however, because audience members who are color-blind may not be able to distinguish them.
	- Use dark colors for lettering on a white background (contrast).
	- Use no more than two or three colors on any presentation that is not a photo or video.
	- Pretend you are your audience. Sit as far away as they will be sitting, and evaluate the colors you have chosen for their readability and appeal.
## <span id="sc">Displaying Presentational Aids</span>
- Posters.
- Whiteboards or Chalkboards.
- Flip Charts.
- Handouts.

2. Position presentational aids and equipment where all audience members can see or hear them.
3. Show and/or play presentational aids only when talking about them so they do not distract audience members from your message.
4. Pass objects and handouts after AFTER rather than during the speech so they do not become a distraction
5. Talk about the visual aid while showing it, and the audio or audiovisual aid just before and after playing it.
# <span id="c">Chapter 14</span>
## <span id="sc">Oral Style</span>
1. An effective oral style tends toward short sentences and familiar language.
2. An effective oral style features plural personal pronouns.

	- Repetition (is restarting words, phrases, or sentences for emphasis)
	- Antithesis (is combining contrasting ideas in the same sentence, as when John F. Kennedy said, "My Fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what can you do for your country.")
# <span id="c">Chapter 15</span>
## <span id="sc">Public speaking apprehension</span>
is the level of fear a person experiences when anticipating or actually speaking to an audience.
### <span id="sec">Symptoms and Causes</span>
- <span id="i">The anticipation phase</span> is the anxiety we experience before giving the speech, both while preparing for it and waiting to speak.
- <span id="i">The confrontation phase</span> is the surge of anxiety we feel as we begin delivering the speech.
- <span id="i">The adaption phase</span> is the period during which our anxiety level gradually decreases.
<span id="sec">Management Techniques</span>
- <span id="i">Communication Orientation Motivation (COM)</span> helps reduce anxiety by adopting a communication rather than performance orientation toward speeches. (We believe we must impress the audience, but with COM we focus on actually just delivering the lesson and communicating with our audience.)
- <span id="i">Visualization</span> helps reduce anxiety by developing a mental picture of ourselves and giving a masterful speech.
- <span id="i">Systematic Desensitization</span> can help reduce anxiety by gradually visualizing and engaging in increasingly more frightening speaking events while remaining in a relaxed state.
- <span id="i">Cognitive Restructuring</span>
	- Identify your fears
	- Determine whether or not these fears are rational
	- Develop positive coping statements to replace each negative self-talk statement.
